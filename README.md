# Node-Based Image Manipulation Framework

This is a node-based image manipulation framework implemented in C++. The system allows users to apply various image processing operations through a modular, node-based structure. Each node represents an individual operation, such as applying filters, adjusting brightness and contrast, edge detection, and more. Nodes can be connected to form a flexible and customizable processing pipeline.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each image processing operation is encapsulated within its own node, which can be easily connected to other nodes.
- **Flexible Image Processing**: Includes nodes for image input/output, color channel manipulation, brightness/contrast adjustments, blurring, edge detection, thresholding, and more.
- **Graph-Based Workflow**: Nodes are organized and connected in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which ensures efficient data flow and processing.
- **Easy Extension**: New nodes can be added to extend the functionality of the framework.

## Key Components

### Nodes

- **ImageInputNode**: Loads an image from the file system and provides it to the graph for processing.
- **OutputNode**: Saves the processed image to a file.
- **ColorChannelSplitterNode**: Splits an image into its individual RGB channels.
- **BrightnessContrastNode**: Adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image.
- **BlurNode**: Applies Gaussian or directional blur to the image.
- **ThresholdNode**: Converts the image to binary based on a thresholding method (binary, adaptive, Otsu).
- **EdgeDetectionNode**: Detects edges in the image using Sobel or Canny edge detection algorithms.
- **BlendNode**: Combines two images together using blending techniques.
- **NoiseGeneratorNode**: Adds noise to an image.
- **ConvolutionFilterNode**: Applies a convolution filter to an image.

### Image Processing Operations

1. **Image Input and Output**: Load and save images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
2. **Color Channel Manipulation**: Split and merge image channels for individual processing.
3. **Brightness/Contrast Adjustment**: Modify the brightness and contrast of an image.
4. **Blurring**: Apply Gaussian or directional blur to the image.
5. **Edge Detection**: Detect edges using Sobel or Canny edge detection algorithms.
6. **Thresholding**: Convert the image into a binary image based on specified thresholding methods (e.g., Otsu's, binary, adaptive).
7. **Blending**: Blend two images together using configurable parameters.

## Example Images

### Original Image
Here is an example of the original image before any processing:
![Original Image](b.jpg)

### Grayscale Image
After applying Directional Blur transformation:
![Blurred Image](Blurred_Image.png)

### Edge Detection (Sobel)
Here is the result of edge detection using the Sobel algorithm:

### Edge Detection (Canny)
This is the result of Blend using multiply operation:

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **C++11 or later**: The framework is implemented in C++ and requires at least C++11 to compile.
- **OpenCV**: The framework uses OpenCV for image processing tasks.
- **ImGui**: Used for the GUI elements to control the parameters of the nodes.

### Dependencies

1. OpenCV (for image processing)
2. ImGui (for the graphical interface)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pulkit-Sheoran-ux/Node-Based-Image-Manipulation.git
    ```

2. Install OpenCV and ImGui (either via package manager or build from source).
3. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file for building the project.
4. Use CMake to generate the build files and then compile the project:

    ```bash
    cmake .
    make
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    ./node-image-manipulation
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the following options:

1. **Load Image**: Load an image file for processing.
2. **Apply Operations**: Choose from a list of available image processing operations like brightness/contrast adjustment, edge detection, blur, and more.
3. **Save Output Image**: Save the processed image to your local file system.
4. **Merge Channels**: Merge the individual color channels back into a single image.
5. **Edge Detection**: Apply edge detection using Sobel or Canny.
6. **Thresholding**: Apply different thresholding methods to convert the image to a binary form.

## Example Workflow

Hereâ€™s an example of how the system works:

1. Load an image.
2. Apply a blur (Gaussian or directional).
3. Apply edge detection (Sobel or Canny).
4. Save the processed image.

## Future Enhancements

- **GUI Integration**: Add a graphical user interface for easier interaction with the system (e.g., using Qt).
- **Additional Image Processing Nodes**: Add more advanced nodes such as histogram equalization, image sharpening, and others.
- **Batch Processing**: Add functionality to process multiple images at once, for example, applying the same operations to a batch of images.
